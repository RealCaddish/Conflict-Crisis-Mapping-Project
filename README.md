# Conflict-Crisis-Mapping-Project
A repository for situation maps, developing crisis-map UIs for conflict data, local community engagement, and geoprocessing for crowdsourced data. This repo is a 'jumping off' point to determine where the literature on crisis mapping resides and also focus on areas of work in the field. This project aims to understand crowdsourcing data on conflict zones utilizing data from the ACLED, Ushahidi's community engagement platform, and utilizing fresh tools in web map development with APIs and  frameworks such as Leaflet, D3, Turf.js, and others within a Node.js environment.
