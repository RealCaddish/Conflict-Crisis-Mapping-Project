This repository hosts work in situation maps, crisis-map visualizations for conflict data, local community engagement, and geoprocessing for crowdsourced data. This repo is a 'jumping off' point to determine where the literature on crisis mapping resides and also focus on areas of work in the field. This project aims to understand crowdsourcing data on conflict zones utilizing data from the ACLED, Ushahidi's community engagement platform, and utilizing fresh tools in web map development with APIs and  frameworks such as Leaflet, D3, Turf.js, and others within a Node.js environment. 

Additionally, the project aims to paint a more just portrait on the effects of the latest Web 2.0 frameworks for web cartography by creating new and useful methods for data visualization and UI interactivity. 

The project is data-focused and seeks at first to shy away from user input. It is a <i>data visualization forward </i> project that later adds user inputs to correct and update the map. In other words, initial authorship is tightly under editorial control to assure that the quality is not compromised. Furthermore, the project aims to implement guidance provided by <i> Dodge and Kitchin </i> in their critique on the utility of Web 2.0 technologies. They state, 
<i><center>"...the value of Web 2.0 is not in producing raw content, but in terms of being able to assemble an army of editors...who can identify mistakes and improve large preexisting information resources or projects. The potential of the crowd lies in correction and not creation." </i>(Dodge and Kitchin 2012: 24) </center>

The project is intended to offer its users an effective means to understand their situational environment more comprehensively. By utilizing front-end geoprocessing tools, mobile/desktop HTML frameworks such as Bootstrap, and an assortment of other useful tools and libraries, the project should help end users better understand their envrironments as they relate to armed conflict. 

A future challenge to this project would be future implementation of user interacivity with options for crowdsourcing, adding SM, and other useful data streams. This would add to the attraction and utility of the UI. More attention should be given to understanding of system architecture and more complex analysis of the software pipeline. Below is a table of contents and citations that I'll continue to write down as I further develop the project. 

Below are resources for datasets that will be useful for this project: 

1. [The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project](https://acleddata.com/acled-religion) is extremely useful for conflict data hosted by this non-profit organization. They have a relatively new portal for religious violence data that could be a useful test case for this project. 

2. [The Human Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) provides a whole host of useful humanitarian data sets. They have a wide array of different development and resource datasets that can be useful for information mining. 

3. [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/) is a company that gained popularity for its crowdsourcing capabilites during the Kenyan election violence of 2008. They also hosted crisis mapping campaigns for Haiti's earthquake and a transparency watch for Macedonian corrpuption. They've grown as a company and may prove to be useful in my thesis research. 

As more research is conducted, a better vision of where this project should probe will become more clear. Right now, these are just initial thoughts about the effectiveness and potentiality that these new technologies can take me.
