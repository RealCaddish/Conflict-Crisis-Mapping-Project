This repository hosts the Ukrainian War Information Mapping Project. It is designed to collect and process data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project's RESTful API in order to properly map confrontations and destroyed infrastructure that is currently taking place in Ukraine. This project aims to contextualize and inform the public of events happening in real-time as they're updated in eastern Europe. 

Additionally, the project aims to paint a more just portrait on the effects of the latest Web 2.0 frameworks for web cartography by creating new and useful methods for data visualization and UI interactivity. Data from the ACLED's RESTful servers will provide updated content throughout the map and user interface. This will be integral towards providing an up-to-date account of what is happening in real time. 


The users in mind for this project should be considered first and foremost. By utilizing front-end geoprocessing tools, mobile/desktop HTML frameworks such as Bootstrap, and an assortment of other useful tools and libraries, the project should help end users better understand the magnitude of the situation on the ground in Ukraine as it unfolds.

A future challenge to this project would be future implementation of user interactivity with options for crowdsourcing, adding SM, and other useful data streams. This would add to the attraction and utility of the UI. More attention should be given to understanding of system architecture and more complex analysis of the software pipeline. Below is a table of contents and citations that I'll continue to write down as I further develop the project. 

Below are resources for datasets that will be useful for this project: 

1. [The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project](https://acleddata.com/acled-religion) is extremely useful for conflict data hosted by this non-profit organization. They have a relatively new portal for religious violence data that could be a useful test case for this project. 

2. [The Human Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) provides a whole host of useful humanitarian data sets. They have a wide array of different development and resource datasets that can be useful for information mining. 

3. [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/) is a company that gained popularity for its crowdsourcing capabilities during the Kenyan election violence of 2008. They also hosted crisis mapping campaigns for Haiti's earthquake and a transparency watch for Macedonian corruption. They've grown as a company and may prove to be useful in my thesis research. 

4. The [ACLED Early Warning Research Hub ](https://acleddata.com/early-warning-research-hub/#tools) is a useful website off of the ACLED main page. This could provide useful data for visualizing up-to-the-date information in the UI. 
   
5. The [ACLED RESTful API User Guide](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acleddata.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fdlm_uploads%2F2017%2F10%2FAPI-User-Guide.pdf&clen=361440&chunk=true)
